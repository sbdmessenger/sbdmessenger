<h5>THIS TOOL: SBDMESSENGER</h5>
<p>Using sbdmessenger, you can tip and message to active Steemit users in their wallet with a click of a button! </p>
<h5>HOW TO FILL THE FORM</h5>
<p>The way it works is pretty simple. All you need to do is fill the form just below. The number of inactive hours represents the number of hours you find acceptable to consider a user active before their last post/comment. In other words, if you put in 24, I will only tip those followers who have posted or commented on steemit in the past 24 hours and I will skip the rest of the users. Once you're finished filling the form, click on <strong>Calculate Fee</strong> and I will calculate the total fee that is required to finish all the transactions.</p>

<h5>CALCULATE FEE VS. TIP/TRANSFER</h5>
<p>Once you enter the valid information and click on <strong>Calculate Fee</strong>, I will then calculate the fee and will enable the <strong>Tip/Transfer</strong> button if your balance is sufficient enough. Please be advised that this code will run on the client machine; that is the code will run on your computer. If your computer shuts down or if you close the window while the app is sending money to the users, the application will stop in the middle of transactions and it will not complete the transactions. Also, please keep in mind that all committed transactions will be <strong>non-refundable</strong>. I will show a confirmation message about these information, once you click on <strong>Tip/Transfer</strong> as you can see below.</p>

<h5>WHAT'S @SBDMESSENGER'S FEE?</h5>
<p>This is what I charge and depends on the number of active users or the total number of transactions. As I mentioned above, this fee is currently 0.001 SBD. In the screenshot above, the number active users is 439 which makes the total fee equal to 0.439 SBD. The total fee will be my fee plus the amount of tips you're going to send to the users. If you have 1000 active users for example, and you want to send them 0.001 SBD which is the minimum amount of tip you have to send, the total fee will be my fee which is 1 SBD in this case plus the total amount of tips which will also be 1 SBD in this case which makes it to be 2 SBD.</p>

<h5>DISCLAIMER</h5>
<p>SBDMESSENGER will NOT save your active key. It will only use it to interact with the blockchain. Also, <strong>your active key is NOT your password. You need to enter your active key not your password!</strong> You can get your active key from your wallet under "Permissions." You may need to login again, using your master key or password! And last but not least, make sure you have good internet connection and enough power before you click on <strong>Tip/Transfer</strong>. Also, be advised that calculating the fee can take a bit of time if you have a lot of users. The more users you get, the longer it's going to take!</p>
